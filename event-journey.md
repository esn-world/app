# Event journey in the TUMi app

From template to cost calculation

### The events overview

The central screen of the app is the events overview, this is where section members and internationals go to see what is coming up and register for the events they are interested in.  
But how does an event end up in this overview?

## Step 1: Template

Most events are not entirely new, so the app helps out with providing a rich library of templates that where created for every event. The section member can look at different templates and select the one that fits their event. The template already includes some useful information and presets for the event description.

## Step 2: Event details

After we selected our template we can add a new event based on the template. This requires some additional information about the event. Once all information is provided, the event can be created. After creation, all aspects of the event can be edited to make it ready for publication.

## Step 3: Registrations

After the registration start date has passed, all students can register for the event. This happens online and optionally with a payment. The registration is fully automatic and leads to the population of the participant lists. Once the assigned spots are reached, the registration closes.

## Step 4: Running the event

The section members that are registered as organizers for the event receive a full overview that allows them to run the event without much effort. At the event location, the organizers scan the QR codes of every participant to check them in, this is both to verify that all participants are registered and to take attendance.

## Finances and admin view

While the event itself is over at this time, there are some interesting additional features. Every event has an admin view that shows more info about every signup and allows some actions such as removing users from the event and refunding payments. The finances are used to collect receipts that account for expenses associated with the event.

## Step 6: Feedback

All participants and organizers for an event are automatically asked for feedback in order to improve the events in the future.
