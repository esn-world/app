  <h2 class="mb-2">You are about to send away your event spot</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-normal">
    Please read the following information: <br />
    To give away this event registration you can generate a special code that
    will allow another person to claim your registration in their profile. This
    process cannot be undone. <br />
    During the transfer, we will refund your participation fee after collecting
    it from the person taking over your registration. <br />
    <br />
    <span class="font-bold">Watch out</span> <br />
    The transfer is only complete after the recipient has paid the event fee,
    this is also the time when you will receive a refund of your fee. Just
    creating the transfer request is not enough, only if someone uses you code
    the transfer will be completed.
